%% User Guide to TopoToolbox - Introduction
%
% <<TopoToolbox.png>>
%
% TopoToolbox provides a set of Matlab functions that support the analysis
% of relief and flow pathways in digital elevation models. The major 
% aim of TopoToolbox is to offer helpful analytical GIS utilities in a 
% non-GIS environment in order to support the simultaneous application
% of GIS-specific and other quantitative methods. 
%
% TopoToolbox is written in the Matlab language and requires the Image
% Processing Toolbox for various functions.
%
%% TopoToolbox 2
%
% TopoToolbox version 2 is a major update to the Toolbox. The main
% difference to previous versions are
%
% * the introduction of an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach and
% the implementation of new classes such as GRIDobj, FLOWobj and STREAMobj.
% All objects carry information (properties) on spatial referencing,
% information that was previously stored using coordinate matrices that
% required large memory space.
% * a new representation of flow direction. TopoToolbox 1 used the sparse
% flow direction matrix to store flow direction and compute flow related
% variables. The new representation allows for much faster function
% evaluation that usually requires much less overhead memory.
% * various GUIs mainly for geomorphological and geomorphometric
% applications which are intended to make various analyses easier and
% faster.
% * higher computational efficiency by coding various functions as C-MEX
% files. Note that these functions should be compiled on your system.
% However, TopoToolbox runs without compilation, yet, less fast.
%
%% TopoToolbox 2: limitations
% 
% Flow related algorithms in TopoToolbox 2 recently only support the single
% flow direction (D8) representation. If you are a user of TopoToolbox 1,
% you may see this as a major limitation. Our advice is to keep both the
% last version (1.6) and version 2 on the search path. It will be shown 
% in the next userguide how to use the multiple flow direction algorithm in
% version 2.
%
%% About the User Guide
%
% This user guide is intended as a basic introduction to the TopoToolbox.
% It won't give a comprehensive overview on the functions available but 
% serves a documentation for a sample session. In addition, this user guide
% provides an account for the command-line based tools of TopoToolbox only. 
% It does not expand upon the use of the GUIs.
%
%% Load a DEM into Matlab
%
% TopoToolbox 2 reads the ESRI ascii grid format and single band geotiffs 
% into an instance of GRIDobj. 
%
% *Note that, throughout the use of TopoToolbox, it is assumed that the DEM
% has a projected coordinate system (e.g. UTM WGS84) and that elevation and 
% horizontal coordinates are in meter units.*
%
DEM = GRIDobj('srtm_bigtujunga30m_utm11.tif');

%%
% DEM is now an instance of the class |GRIDobj|. DEM contains various
% properties that contain the gridded data and information on the spatial
% referencing of the grid.
%
DEM

%%
% The data is stored in the property |.Z|. You can access it using linear
% indexing, subscripts or logical indexing as you are used to do with
% standard Matlab matrices and arrays. E.g. the upper-left 5x5 pixel in the
% grid can be accessed by following command.
%
DEM.Z(1:5,1:5)

%%
% GRIDobj is associated with various methods. Some of these methods
% overwrite existing builtin functions (e.g. |plus|, |minus|, |isnan|) or
% functions that ship with previous versions of TopoToolbox (e.g.
% |gradient8|, |curvature|, |fillsinks|). Here is an overview of the
% methods (functions) associated with |GRIDobj|

methods GRIDobj

%% View the DEM
%
% Matlab provides numerous ways to display gridded data (images). Among
% these are |imagesc|, |surf|, |pcolor|, |imshow|, etc. 
% TopoToolbox overwrites only |imagesc| and |surf|

imagesc(DEM)

%%
% Note that the axes contain the x and y coordinates and that the axes are
% set to image (axis image).
%
% Another useful function is imageschs which displays an instance of
% |GRIDobj| and overlays it with the DEM. Here we display the slope (see
% function |gradient8|) overlayn with the hillshade calculated from DEM.
% For visualization purposes the color range is restricted to slopes less
% than 1 m/m.
imageschs(DEM,min(gradient8(DEM),1))

%%
% If none of the available visualization functions are what you are looking
% for, you can simply convert your DEM to the standard representation using
% GRIDobj2mat. The function returns two coordinate vectors and a matrix
% with values. Here we crop our DEM to a smaller extent beforehand.
DEMc = crop(DEM,sub2ind(DEM.size,[1 50],[1 50]));
[Z,x,y] = GRIDobj2mat(DEMc);
surf(x,y,double(Z))

%%
% Note: See the help of the function |crop| on other ways to clip your data
% to a desired extent.

%% Topographic attributes
% Topographic attributes are derivatives obtained from a DEM such as slope,
% exposition or curvature. We assume that you are familiar with the meaning
% of these attributes and you will notice must of the functions by their
% function name such as
%
% * |gradient8| -> as opposed to the Matlab builtin gradient function,
% |gradient8| calculates the gradient in 8 possible directions for each
% cell.
% * |curvature| -> the second derivative of a DEM.
% * |roughness| -> allows you calculate various roughness indices related
% to intercell, topographic variability such as ruggedness etc.
% * |aspect| -> slope exposition
% * and many more
%

%% Export an instance of GRIDobj to the disk
%
% TopoToolbox ships with two functions for writing instances of GRIDobj
% back the hard drive so that they can be read by standard GIS software
% such as ArcGIS etc.
%
GRIDobj2ascii(DEMc,'test.txt');
GRIDobj2geotiff(DEMc,'test.tif');

%%
% Note that writing geotiffs is possible without having the mapping toolbox
% available, however, TopoToolbox will then write an image with a tfw-file
% (worldfile). See help |GRIDobj2geotiff| for details.

%% Fill sinks
%
% Often DEMs feature erroneous topographic depressions that should be
% filled prior to flow path computation. You can fill sinks using the
% function |fillsinks|. Note that in some situations it is more appropriate
% to not fill sinks but to carve the DEM which will be shown below (see
% section on FLOWobj).

DEMf = fillsinks(DEM);

%% FLOWobj and flow related functions
%
% Users of previous versions of TopoToolbox will remember that flow
% direction was stored as a sparse matrix that contained the information of
% the directed acyclic graph of the flow network. TopoToolbox 2 uses a
% novel technique to store flow direction that allows for easy coding and
% fast performance. Flow direction is stored as a new object, |FLOWobj|, an
% instance of which is derived from an existing DEM (instance of
% |GRIDobj|).
%
% Here is a fast way to calculate flow accumulation based on the previously
% sink filled DEM. The flow accumulation grid is dilated a little bit, so
% that flow paths are more easily appreciated in the figure.

FD = FLOWobj(DEMf);
A  = flowacc(FD);
imageschs(DEM,dilate(sqrt(A),ones(5)),'colormap',flipud(copper));

%%
% When creating an instance of |FLOWobj|, you can set numerous options that 
% are summarized in the help of |FLOWobj|. 

%% Methods associated with FLOWobj
%
% Various methods exist that operate on instances of FLOWobj to obtain flow
% related variables such as drainage basin delineation, flow accumulation, 
% etc. Here is an overview
%
methods FLOWobj

%%
% Now, let's calculate the drainage basins of the DEM. This can be done
% using the function |drainagebasins|. You may want to shuffle the colors
% so that the drainage basins can be more easily distinguished in a plot
% (|shufflelabel|). As a small exercise, let's denote the area of each 
% basin in the map. 

DB = drainagebasins(FD);
DB = shufflelabel(DB);

%%
% Easy until here. Now let's get the area and display
% it together with the drainage basins map. Display only
% numbers for drainage basins larger than 10 km^2.

nrDB = numel(unique(DB.Z(:)))-1; % nr of drainage basins
STATS = regionprops(DB.Z,'PixelIdxList','Area','Centroid');

imageschs(DEM,DB);

hold on
for run = 1:nrDB;
    if STATS(run).Area*DB.cellsize^2 > 10e6;
        [x,y] = ind2coord(DB,...
            sub2ind(DB.size,...
            round(STATS(run).Centroid(2)),...
            round(STATS(run).Centroid(1))));
        text(x,y,...
            num2str(round(STATS(run).Area * DB.cellsize^2/1e6)),...
            'BackgroundColor',[1 1 1]);
    end
end
hold off
title('drainage basins (numbers refer to drainage basin area in km^2)')

%%
% It may also be interesting to know the distance from each drainage basin
% outlet in upstream direction along the flow network.
%
D = flowdistance(FD);
imageschs(DEM,D);

%%
% You can use the output of flowdistance to calculate the area function
% which is the distribution of flow distances to the outlet of a specific
% basin. Let's take the largest basin in our study site.

[~,IX] = max([STATS.Area]);
hist(D.Z(DB.Z == IX),1000);
xlabel('distance to outlet [m]');
ylabel('# cells');

%% STREAMobj - a class for stream networks
%
% While FLOWobj stores the information on the entire flow network on
% hillslopes and in channels, STREAMobj is a class that is used to analyze 
% the channelized part of the flow network only. The storage strategy is
% very similar to the one of the class FLOWobj.
%
% Again, various methods (functions) are associated with STREAMobj that
% allow for manipulating, plotting and retrieving information on the stream
% network geometry and patterns.
%
% There are various ways to extract the channelized flow network from DEMs.
% In this example we simply use an area threshold.

% calculate flow accumulation
A = flowacc(FD);
% Note that flowacc returns the number of cells draining
% in a cell. Here we choose a minimum drainage area of 10000 cells.
W = A>10000;
% create an instance of STREAMobj
S = STREAMobj(FD,W);
% and plot it
plot(S)

%%
% STREAMobj stores various properties some of which you might use to
% directly access if you want to customize your code or build your own
% functions. Please check the help of STREAMobj.

%%
% Now let's extract the largest subnetwork of the channel network. 
S = klargestconncomps(S,1);
plot(S)

%%
% and let's plot flow distance along the stream network versus elevation.
plotdz(S,DEM)

%%
% If you have a license of Matlab's Mapping Toolbox you can export the
% stream network to a shapefile to be read by other GIS software. First,
% you need to create a mapstruct, a structure array used by the mapping
% toolbox to store vector data. Then use shapewrite to write the mapstruct
% to a shapefile.
MS = STREAMobj2mapstruct(S);
shapewrite(MS,'testshape.shp')
