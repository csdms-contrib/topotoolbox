%% Getting started with TopoToolbox
% TopoToolbox is a comprehensive function library for digital elevation model 
% (DEM) analysis. The main strength of TopoToolbox lies in the analysis of gridded 
% DEMs, as well as flow and stream networks. The tools have been implemented within 
% an object-oriented MATLAB class hierarchy. 
% 
% TopoToolbox is for DEM analysis in a broad scope of geoscientific disciplines 
% including geomorphology, structural geology, hydrology, glaciology, paleoseismology 
% and natural hazards research, among others.   
% 
% This document serves as a brief introduction to using TopoToolbox from the 
% command line interface. 
%% Are you new to MATLAB?
% Have you worked with MATLAB before? Can you write MATLAB code? If yes, using 
% TopoToolbox will be easy. All you need is to understand the basic structure 
% of the TopoToolbox classes GRIDobj, FLOWobj, and STREAMobj. In addition, get 
% familiar with the functions of each class. You'll find an overview including 
% one-sentence descriptions in the function reference.
% 
% Do you have no experience with MATLAB? Now this will be more tricky then. 
% Though TopoToolbox has a few graphical user interfaces, we assume that users 
% use the command line or scripting to access the functionality of the toolbox. 
% Yet, there is no reason to get lost. The MATLAB documentation offers a smooth 
% entry into MATLAB programming. In addition, the examples below will start from 
% scratch. Copy and paste them to the command line and you'll get familiar with 
% the syntax in short time.
