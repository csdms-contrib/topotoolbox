# TopoToolbox - a set of Matlab functions for topographic analysis

<img src="https://github.com/wschwanghart/topotoolbox/blob/master/topotoolbox.jpg" align="center" height="100">

[TopoToolbox](http://topotoolbox.wordpress.com) provides a set of Matlab functions that support the analysis
of relief and flow pathways in digital elevation models. The major 
aim of TopoToolbox is to offer helpful analytical GIS utilities in a 
non-GIS environment in order to support the simultaneous application
of GIS-specific and other quantitative methods.

## Requirements

TopoToolbox is plat-form independent and requires
Matlab 2014b or higher and the Image Processing Toolbox. The Mapping
Toolbox is not mandatory, but good to have to facilitate easy data
exchange with GIS software.

## Getting started

Before working with TopoToolbox the directories and functions must be on the search 
path of Matlab. Enter following code into the command line:

        addpath(genpath('C:\path\to\wherever\you\installed\this\TopoToolbox-2'))
		
To remove .git-folders from the path, run

        rmpath(genpath('C:\path\to\wherever\you\installed\this\TopoToolbox-2\.git'));

Type `doc` in the command line to open the main documentation page. You'll 
find the TopoToolbox documentation in the section Supplemental Software.  
The documentation contains several user's guides that will help you 
getting started. In addition, TopoToolbox functions have extensive help 
sections (e.g. `help gradient8` or `help STREAMobj/modify`. An additional 
resource for code and examples is the [TopoToolbox blog](http://topotoolbox.wordpress.com).

### V2.0beta 

V2.0 introduces an object oriented approach towards grid representation, flow direction, stream 
networks and swath objects. The performance of various, inparticular flow related, functions was 
increased. Mex-files have been written to increase the speed of some functions and are delivered as 
64bit Windows binaries. They have been compiled on Windows 7 with an Intel processor, so they should be 
compiled before using them, if your system differs. However, compiling is not mandatory, since m 
versions are available, too, which are a little slower. Please refer to the Contents.m file for a 
complete list of functions.
