%% User Guide to TopoToolbox - Plotting ksn-values
%
% <<TopoToolbox.png>>
%
%% Background
%
% Stream profiles carry information on tectonic and/or climatic
% perturbations in the form of knickpoints migrating in upstream direction.
% Plotting ksn-values provides a means to quantify deviations from the
% logarithmic channel length profile and thus enables to detect and
% visualize these locations in the stream network.
%
% The basic assumption behind ksn-values is that the stream power model of
% sediment transport/incision applies, e.g., sediment transport or incision 
% are functions of the energy expenditure of water when moving downstream. 
% In a landscape evolution context, the stream power model is written in
% following (simplified) form
%
% $$\frac{dz}{dt} = U - k A^m \left( \frac{dz}{dx} \right)^n$$
%
% where $U$ refers to the uplift rate, $A$ is the upslope area, $dz/dx$ is
% the slope and $k$, $m$ and $n$ are coefficients. In steady state the
% processes uplift and incision are in equilibrium such that $dz/dt = 0$ at
% each point along the profile. Hence, the equation is rearranged
%
% $$\left( \frac{dz}{dx} \right)^n = \frac{U}{k A^m}$$
%
% $$\frac{dz}{dx} = \left( \frac{U}{k} \right)^{1/n} A^{-n/m}$$
%
% The terms are rewritten so that
%
% $$S = k_{sn} A^{-\theta}$$
%
% and
%
% $$k_{sn} = \frac{S}{A^{-\theta}}$$
%
% where $k_{sn}$ refers to the normalized channel steepness and $\theta$ to
% the channel concavity. $\theta$ ranges between 0.3 and 0.8 and often
% takes on the value 0.45. It can be determined either based on slope-area
% plots (see function slopearea) or $\chi$-plots (see function chiplot).
%
%% Load and generate required data
%
DEM = GRIDobj('srtm_bigtujunga30m_utm11.tif');
FD  = FLOWobj(DEM,'preprocess','carve');
A   = flowacc(FD);
%%
% The quality of the DEM is relatively bad, so we correct it by imposing a
% downward minimum gradient.
DEM = imposemin(FD,DEM,0.0001);

%%
% Subsequently, we extract a stream network by thresholding flow
% accumulation. In this example, we simply assume that channels occupy
% cells that have a minimum upslope area of 1000 pixels.

S  = STREAMobj(FD,'minarea',1000);
S = klargestconncomps(S,1);

%% 
% We modify the stream network somewhat so that we avoid to include the
% alluvial areas in the most downstream portion of the profile. 
S = modify(S,'distance',10000);

%%
% In order to remove small stream sections we again extract the largest
% connected component of the network
S = klargestconncomps(S,1);
imageschs(DEM);

%% Calculating the concavity index
%
% After extracting the channel network of interest, we calculate the
% concavity index $\theta$ using the slopearea function.
% *Note that* slopearea returns the concavity index $\theta$ including its 
% negative sign!

STATS = slopearea(S,DEM,A)

%% Calculate and plot ksn values
%
% Subsequently, we calculate the ksn-values for the entire grid. While this
% won't make sense for hillslope sections, our aim is to generate a grid
% that we can later reference with the stream network (STREAMobj).

G   = gradient8(DEM);
KSN = G./(A.*(A.cellsize^2)).^STATS.theta;

[x,y,ksn] = STREAMobj2XY(S,KSN);
scatter(x,y,5,ksn,'filled')

%% Aggregate ksn values in stream segments
%
% Note that in the above figure each channel location in the grid is
% plotted. There are two problems arising from doing so. First, owing to
% the high point density in the xy plane some of the points and their color
% may not be visible due to overlapping. Second, owing to the poor quality
% of the DEM the ksn-values are strongly variable at short distances. Note 
% the large variability in the main river trunk! To avoid both problems,
% ksn values should be generalized along stream segments. This is achieved
% with the function STREAMobj2mapstruct. Here we use a stream segment
% length of 1 km (1000 m).

MS = STREAMobj2mapstruct(S,'seglength',1000,'attributes',...
    {'ksn' KSN @mean ...
     'uparea' (A.*(A.cellsize^2)) @mean ...
     'gradient' G @mean});

%% Plot stream segments
%
% MS is a mapstruct that you can plot using mapshow and makesymbolspec.
% Both functions are available with the mapping toolbox. We use a coloring
% based on percentiles of the data.

symbolspec = makesymbolspec('line',...
    {'ksn' [min([MS.ksn]) max([MS.ksn])] 'color' jet(6)});

imageschs(DEM,DEM,'colormap',gray,'colorbar',false);
mapshow(MS,'SymbolSpec',symbolspec);

%% Export as shapefile
%
% Alternativly, you may want to choose another software to visualize the
% stream network together with ksn values. In order to do so, you will need
% the function shapewrite available with the mapping toolbox (in case you
% don't have access to the toolbox, check the Mathworks fileexchange for
% functions with same functionality). 
%
% shapewrite(MS,'ksn_testshape.shp');
