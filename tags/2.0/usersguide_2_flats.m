%% User Guide to TopoToolbox - Processing flats
%
% Flat areas are challenging when calculating flow directions in a DEM
% since flow directions cannot be derived from a simple neighborhood
% search. Thus, different techniques exist to process flats and some of
% them are implemented in TopoToolbox.
%
% Note that you should have Matlab R2011b to run this demo.

%% Identify flats
% 
% Hydrological conditioning is usually applied to preprocessing a DEM. The
% most common technique is sink filling (|fillsinks|) to remove spurious
% pits. Sink filling, in turn creates flats.
%
% Let's first load the Baranja Hill model

load baranja_hill
surf(X,Y,dem);
exaggerate(gca,1);
shading interp; camlight
% for zooming
extent = {[6551884,6553799.03205128],[5072228.94341349,5074170.03032261]};

%%
% The first step is to fill all sinks. We can calculate the fill depth by
% subtracting the filled DEM from the original DEM.
demf = fillsinks(dem);
DZ   = demf-dem;
imageschs(X,Y,dem,DZ);

%%
% We can also create a mask that indicates flat pixels using the function
% |identifyflats|. You can see that there are various flat areas with 
% different extents. Some of them are single pixels only, others comprise 
% large contiguous areas. As long as flats are not regional minima, each
% flat should have one or several sills pixels, e.g. pixels adjacent to
% flats with a downward neighbor.
[FLATS,SILLS]    = identifyflats(demf);
imageschs(X,Y,dem,FLATS+2*SILLS);

%% Three methods to process flats
%
% There a three methods implemented in TopoToolbox to process flats.
%
% # |crossflats|
% # |routeflats|
% # |routegeodesic|
%
% All of them are called from within |flowdir| or |flowdir_single|.

%% Crossflats
%
% |crossflats| is the most basic way to process flats. Basically, it
% doesn't even try to assign flow directions to flat pixels, but it just 
% establishes flow connectivity between pixels entering flats and sill
% pixels. 

Mc = flowdir(X,Y,demf,'routeflats','cross','type','single');
imageschs(X,Y,dem);
hold on
gplot(Mc,[X(:) Y(:)],'k');
hold off
setextent(extent)

%% 
% While this is a fast method to route through flats, it may not be suited
% for many applications and visualizations.

%% Routeflats
%
% |routeflats| uses a recursive upstream processing to establish flow paths
% through flats. The algorithm starts at sill pixels and then finds its way
% upstream. The advantage of the algorithm is its speed. It is reasonably
% fast and would be even faster, if it was implemented as MEX-file.
% Its major disadantage is, that it doesn't process flats that are
% connected to the edge of the DEM.

Mr = flowdir(X,Y,demf,'routeflats','route','type','single');
imageschs(X,Y,dem);
hold on
gplot(Mr,[X(:) Y(:)],'k');
hold off
setextent(extent)

%% Routegeodesic
%
% The most elegant way to route through flats is implemented in
% |routegeodesic|. The algorithm uses an auxiliary topography in flats
% based on least cost paths where the costs are calculated from the
% complemented distance transform. This generates flow paths that run along
% the centerline of sinks and produces the best looking and probably most
% realistic flow path representation through flat areas.
%

Mg = flowdir(X,Y,demf,'routeflats','geodesic','type','single');
imageschs(X,Y,dem);
hold on
gplot(Mg,[X(:) Y(:)],'k');
hold off
setextent(extent)

%% Compare the three
%
% Now let's visually compare the three algorithms using flow accumulation.

Ac = flowacc(Mc,size(dem));
Ar = flowacc(Mr,size(dem));
Ag = flowacc(Mg,size(dem));

figure
surf(X,Y,dem,log(Ac));
exaggerate(gca,1);
shading interp; camlight
title('crossflats')

figure
surf(X,Y,dem,log(Ar));
exaggerate(gca,1);
shading interp; camlight
title('routeflats')

figure
surf(X,Y,dem,log(Ag));
exaggerate(gca,1);
shading interp; camlight
